      "content": "1. **Incorrect Handling of \"Before Noon\" Ambiguity:** The code assumes \"before noon\" is always 11:59am, which is arbitrary. The actual range for \"before noon\" is from 12:00am to 11:59am, so the deadline could fall on up to three days (the day before, the same day, or the next day), depending on the value of Z'. The code only considers the current and next day, potentially missing valid days.\n\n2. **Arbitrary Base Date for Day-of-Week Calculations:** The code uses January 1, 2023 (a Sunday) as a base date for all day-of-week calculations. While this works for relative day-of-week math, it is not robust if the weekday mapping changes or if the base date is not Sunday. This could lead to errors if the base date is changed or misunderstood.\n\n3. **Hardcoded Year in Q' Calculations:** The code uses 2023 as the year for Q' calculations, which is unrelated to the actual years involved in the problem. This is acceptable for day-of-week math but is not generalizable or clearly justified.\n\n4. **No Input Validation:** The code does not validate the input symbols or check for missing or malformed data, which could lead to runtime errors if the input format changes.\n\n5. **Unnecessary Complexity in Date Calculations:** The code overcomplicates the process by creating arbitrary dates to match days of the week, rather than simply using modular arithmetic on the weekday indices.\n\n6. **No Explanation or Comments for Key Steps:** Some steps, such as why 2023-01-01 is chosen or how the day overflow is handled, lack clear comments, making the logic harder to follow and verify.\n\nDespite these issues, the code produces a plausible answer for the given input, but the ambiguity in \"before noon\" and the arbitrary choices in date handling could lead to incorrect or incomplete results in other scenarios.",

The deadline could be on:\n  - The same day if Z' < 12\n  - The next day if Z' >= 12 and < 36, etc.\n  - The previous day if Z' >= 24 (if before noon, and deadline is in 24+ hours, it could be the day before).\n- For the deadline, consider all possible days of the week the deadline could fall on, given the range of possible \"before noon\" times.\n\n### Revised Code\n\n```python\ndef solve(symbols):\n    import calendar\n\n    # Helper: get weekday index from name\n    def weekday_index(name):\n        return list(calendar.day_name).index(name)\n\n    # Helper: get weekday name from index\n    def weekday_name(idx):\n        return list(calendar.day_name)[idx % 7]\n\n    # Question 1: Subtract 17 months from 09-13-2011\n    m, d, y = 9, 13, 2011\n    months_before = 17\n    total_months = y * 12 + m - 1\n    new_total_months = total_months - months_before\n    new_y = new_total_months // 12\n    new_m = new_total_months % 12 + 1\n    # Handle day overflow\n    import calendar\n    last_day = calendar.monthrange(new_y, new_m)[1]\n    new_d = min(d, last_day)\n    X, Y, Z = new_m, new_d, new_y\n\n    # Question 2: X' = X + 10, today is Sunday\n    X_prime = X + 10\n    today_idx = weekday_index(\"Sunday\")\n    P_idx = (today_idx + X_prime) % 7\n    P = weekday_name(P_idx)\n\n    # Question 3: Y' = Y + 16, P' = 45 days after P\n    Y_prime = Y + 16\n    P_prime_idx = (P_idx + 45) % 7\n    P_prime = weekday_name(P_prime_idx)\n    # On P' morning, package was out for delivery Y' days ago\n    Q_idx = (P_prime_idx - (Y_prime % 7)) % 7\n    Q = weekday_name(Q_idx)\n\n    # Question 4: Z' = Z - 1984, Q' = 75 days after Q\n    Z_prime = Z - 1984\n    Q_prime_idx = (Q_idx + 75) % 7\n    Q_prime = weekday_name(Q_prime_idx)\n\n    # On Q' before noon, deadline is in exactly Z' hours\n    # \"Before noon\" is any time from 0:00 to 11:59, so the deadline could be on:\n    # - Q' if Z' < 12\n    # - Q'+1 if 12 <= Z' < 36\n    # - Q'+2 if 36 <= Z' < 60, etc.\n    # But since \"before noon\" could be any time in that range, the deadline could fall on up to two days:\n    # - If Z' is not a multiple of 24, the deadline could be on Q' or Q'+1\n    # - If Z' is a multiple of 24, the deadline could be on Q' or Q'+1 (since 0:00 + 24h = next day 0:00)\n    # So, for all t in [0, 12), deadline is Q'+(Z'//24)\n    # for t in [0, 12), deadline is Q'+(Z'//24) if Z'%24 < 12, else Q'+(Z'//24)+1\n    # But since \"before noon\" is a range, the deadline could be on Q'+(Z'//24) or Q'+(Z'//24)+1\n\n    # Let's compute all possible days:\n    days = set()\n    for hour in range(0, 12):  # 0:00 to 11:59\n        deadline_offset = (Z_prime + hour) // 24\n        day_idx = (Q_prime_idx + deadline_offset) % 7\n        days.add(weekday_name(day_idx))\n    answer_list = sorted(days)\n\n    return answer_list\n```\nThis code now robustly handles the \"before noon\" ambiguity and uses modular arithmetic for all day-of-week calculations.",

The logic for adding days and wrapping around the week is sound.\n\n3. **Handling of \"Before Noon\" Range in Question 4:**  \n   The code iterates over all possible hours from 0 to 11 (representing \"before noon\") and computes the possible deadline days, collecting all unique results. This approach is correct and ensures all possible days are considered.\n\n4. **Output Format:**  \n   The code returns the answer as a sorted list of days, as required by the question.\n\n5. **No Unused or Incorrect Returns:**  \n   The code does not return None and does not print instead of returning.\n\n6. **No Simpler Solution:**  \n   The code is already quite direct and clear for the problem's requirements.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThere are no correctness or logic issues in the code.

    "raw_response": "Let's reason through each criterion for the given TARGET QUESTION:\n\n**1. Simple Formalizability**  \nThe question is a multi-step, chained logic problem involving date arithmetic, day-of-week calculations, and variable substitutions. Each step is deterministic and can be formalized, but the chaining and variable passing increase complexity. While each sub-question is formalizable, the risk of misassigning variables or miscalculating offsets is nontrivial.  \n**Probability:** 0.6\n\n**2. Straightforward Executability**  \nWriting code for date arithmetic and day-of-week calculations is feasible using Python's `datetime` module. However, the multi-step variable passing and the need to parse and format dates precisely (e.g., mm/dd/yyyy) introduce room for subtle bugs. A first attempt may miss a variable or misinterpret a step.  \n**Probability:** 0.5\n\n**3. Robust Systematic Search**  \nThe problem does not require search per se, but systematic step-by-step calculation. Code can reliably perform these steps if implemented correctly, but the risk is in mis-sequencing or misapplying the variable transformations.  \n**Probability:** 0.7\n\n**4. Manageable State Representation**  \nAll variables (dates, days, offsets) can be represented as variables in code. However, the chain of dependencies and variable renaming (X, X', etc.) could lead to confusion or misassignment. Still, code can track these if carefully written.  \n**Probability:** 0.7\n\n**5. Structured Knowledge Encoding**  \nAll required knowledge (date arithmetic, day-of-week calculation, variable manipulation) can be encoded in code using standard libraries. No external or intuitive knowledge is needed.  \n**Probability:** 0.9\n\n**6. Hallucination Risk Reduction**  \nCode execution will follow the logic as written, reducing the risk of hallucinating steps or making unwarranted assumptions. However, if the code is written with a misinterpretation, the error will propagate. Still, code is less likely to hallucinate than chain-of-thought.  \n**Probability:** 0.8\n\n**7. Arithmetic and Data Processing Advantage**  \nDate arithmetic and day-of-week calculations are error-prone for humans but trivial for code using the right libraries. Code has a clear advantage here.  \n**Probability:** 0.95\n\n**8.

Simple Formalizability**  \nThe question is a multi-step, chained logic problem involving date arithmetic, day-of-week calculations, and variable substitutions. Each step is deterministic and can be formalized, but the chaining and variable passing increase complexity. While each sub-question is formalizable, the risk of misassigning variables or miscalculating offsets is nontrivial.  \n**Probability:** 0.6\n\n**2. Straightforward Executability**  \nWriting code for date arithmetic and day-of-week calculations is feasible using Python's `datetime` module. However, the multi-step variable passing and the need to parse and format dates precisely (e.g., mm/dd/yyyy) introduce room for subtle bugs. A first attempt may miss a variable or misinterpret a step.  \n**Probability:** 0.5\n\n**3. Robust Systematic Search**  \nThe problem does not require search per se, but systematic step-by-step calculation. Code can reliably perform these steps if implemented correctly, but the risk is in mis-sequencing or misapplying the variable transformations.  \n**Probability:** 0.7\n\n**4. Manageable State Representation**  \nAll variables (dates, days, offsets) can be represented as variables in code. However, the chain of dependencies and variable renaming (X, X', etc.) could lead to confusion or misassignment. Still, code can track these if carefully written.  \n**Probability:** 0.7\n\n**5. Structured Knowledge Encoding**  \nAll required knowledge (date arithmetic, day-of-week calculation, variable manipulation) can be encoded in code using standard libraries. No external or intuitive knowledge is needed.  \n**Probability:** 0.9\n\n**6. Hallucination Risk Reduction**  \nCode execution will follow the logic as written, reducing the risk of hallucinating steps or making unwarranted assumptions. However, if the code is written with a misinterpretation, the error will propagate. Still, code is less likely to hallucinate than chain-of-thought.  \n**Probability:** 0.8\n\n**7. Arithmetic and Data Processing Advantage**  \nDate arithmetic and day-of-week calculations are error-prone for humans but trivial for code using the right libraries. Code has a clear advantage here.  \n**Probability:** 0.95\n\n**8. Branching and Case Handling Advantage**  \nThere are not many branches, but there are multiple chained steps and variable substitutions. Code can systematically handle these, but the main risk is in mis-sequencing, not in missing branches.  \n**Probability:** 0.8\n\n**9.

First extract relevant information from the input as JSON. Try to represent the relevant information in as much of a structured format as possible to help with further reasoning/processing.\n2. Using the information extracted, determine a reasonable approach to solving the problem using code, such that executing the code will return the final answer.\n3. Write a Python program to calculate and return the final answer. Use comments to explain the structure of the code and do not use a main() function.\nThe JSON must be enclosed in a markdown code block and the Python function must be in a separate markdown code block and be called `solve` and accept a single input called `symbols` representing the JSON information extracted. Do not include any `if __name__ == \"__main__\"` statement and you can assume the JSON will be loaded into the variable called `symbols` by the user.\nThe Python code should not just return the answer or perform all reasoning in comments and instead leverage the code itself to perform the reasoning.\nBe careful that the code returns the answer as expected by the question, for instance, if the question is multiple choice, the code must return the choice as described in the question.\nBe sure to always output a JSON code block and a Python code block.\nMake sure to follow these formatting requirements exactly.\n"

The actual range for \"before noon\" is from 12:00am to 11:59am, so the deadline could fall on up to three days (the day before, the same day, or the next day), depending on the value of Z'. The code only considers the current and next day, potentially missing valid days.\n\n2. **Arbitrary Base Date for Day-of-Week Calculations:** The code uses January 1, 2023 (a Sunday) as a base date for all day-of-week calculations. While this works for relative day-of-week math, it is not robust if the weekday mapping changes or if the base date is not Sunday. This could lead to errors if the base date is changed or misunderstood.\n\n3. **Hardcoded Year in Q' Calculations:** The code uses 2023 as the year for Q' calculations, which is unrelated to the actual years involved in the problem. This is acceptable for day-of-week math but is not generalizable or clearly justified.\n\n4. **No Input Validation:** The code does not validate the input symbols or check for missing or malformed data, which could lead to runtime errors if the input format changes.\n\n5. **Unnecessary Complexity in Date Calculations:** The code overcomplicates the process by creating arbitrary dates to match days of the week, rather than simply using modular arithmetic on the weekday indices.\n\n6. **No Explanation or Comments for Key Steps:** Some steps, such as why 2023-01-01 is chosen or how the day overflow is handled, lack clear comments, making the logic harder to follow and verify.\n\nDespite these issues, the code produces a plausible answer for the given input, but the ambiguity in \"before noon\" and the arbitrary choices in date handling could lead to incorrect or incomplete results in other scenarios.\n```\n\nIf there are any issues which impact the correctness of the answer, please output code which does not have the issues. Before outputting any code, plan how the code will solve the problem and avoid the issues.\nIf stuck, try outputting different code to solve the problem in a different way.\nYou may also revise the extracted symbols. To do this, output the revised symbols in a JSON code block. Only include information in the JSON which is present in the original input to keep the code grounded in the specific problem. Some examples of symbol revisions are changing the names of certain symbols, providing further granularity, and adding information which was originally missed.\nIf everything is correct, output the word \"FINISHED\" and nothing else.\n"

First extract relevant information from the input as JSON. Try to represent the relevant information in as much of a structured format as possible to help with further reasoning/processing.\n2. Using the information extracted, determine a reasonable approach to solving the problem using code, such that executing the code will return the final answer.\n3. Write a Python program to calculate and return the final answer. Use comments to explain the structure of the code and do not use a main() function.\nThe JSON must be enclosed in a markdown code block and the Python function must be in a separate markdown code block and be called `solve` and accept a single input called `symbols` representing the JSON information extracted. Do not include any `if __name__ == \"__main__\"` statement and you can assume the JSON will be loaded into the variable called `symbols` by the user.\nThe Python code should not just return the answer or perform all reasoning in comments and instead leverage the code itself to perform the reasoning.\nBe careful that the code returns the answer as expected by the question, for instance, if the question is multiple choice, the code must return the choice as described in the question.\nBe sure to always output a JSON code block and a Python code block.\nMake sure to follow these formatting requirements exactly.\n"

The actual range for \"before noon\" is from 12:00am to 11:59am, so the deadline could fall on up to three days (the day before, the same day, or the next day), depending on the value of Z'. The code only considers the current and next day, potentially missing valid days.\n\n2. **Arbitrary Base Date for Day-of-Week Calculations:** The code uses January 1, 2023 (a Sunday) as a base date for all day-of-week calculations. While this works for relative day-of-week math, it is not robust if the weekday mapping changes or if the base date is not Sunday. This could lead to errors if the base date is changed or misunderstood.\n\n3. **Hardcoded Year in Q' Calculations:** The code uses 2023 as the year for Q' calculations, which is unrelated to the actual years involved in the problem. This is acceptable for day-of-week math but is not generalizable or clearly justified.\n\n4. **No Input Validation:** The code does not validate the input symbols or check for missing or malformed data, which could lead to runtime errors if the input format changes.\n\n5. **Unnecessary Complexity in Date Calculations:** The code overcomplicates the process by creating arbitrary dates to match days of the week, rather than simply using modular arithmetic on the weekday indices.\n\n6. **No Explanation or Comments for Key Steps:** Some steps, such as why 2023-01-01 is chosen or how the day overflow is handled, lack clear comments, making the logic harder to follow and verify.\n\nDespite these issues, the code produces a plausible answer for the given input, but the ambiguity in \"before noon\" and the arbitrary choices in date handling could lead to incorrect or incomplete results in other scenarios.\n```\n\nIf there are any issues which impact the correctness of the answer, please output code which does not have the issues. Before outputting any code, plan how the code will solve the problem and avoid the issues.\nIf stuck, try outputting different code to solve the problem in a different way.\nYou may also revise the extracted symbols.
