Per-Instance Program Synthesis (PIPS) is an adaptive reasoning baseline that decides, for every problem instance, whether to run deliberate chain-of-thought reasoning or synthesize executable Python code.

## News

- **[10/26/2025]** Code for PIPS as well as web interface and gradio app are released.
- **[09/18/2025]** PIPS accepted to NeurIPS 2025!

## Why try PIPS?
- Adaptive per-instance strategy selection that balances executable program synthesis with fast chain-of-thought reasoning.
- Iterative code refinement with automatic execution, error recovery, and optional interactive checkpoints.
- Real-time observability via structured logs, token streaming, and persisted sessions that make debugging or research comparisons easy.
- Drop-in baseline: run the web app with one command or import a single class to embed Per-Instance Program Synthesis inside your stack.

## Install
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd PIPS
pip install -e .

# Optional extras
pip install -e .[web]   # UI dependencies
pip install -e .[dev]   # linting & tests
```

## Configure providers
Export whichever API keys you plan to use:
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="..."
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="..."
export GOOGLE_API_KEY="..."
```
Only one key is required to get started.

## Use PIPS from Python
```python
from pips import PIPSSolver, get_model
from pips.utils import RawInput

model = get_model("gpt-4o", api_key="your-openai-api-key")
solver = PIPSSolver(model=model, max_iterations=8, temperature=0.0)

problem = RawInput(text_input="What is the sum of the first 10 prime numbers?")
answer, telemetry, mode_decision = solver.solve(problem, stream=False)
print("Answer:", answer)
```
Set `stream=True` and pass callbacks such as `on_llm_streaming_token` or
`on_step_update` to receive incremental updates. For complete control you can
call `solve_with_code` or `solve_chain_of_thought` directly, and the same
callbacks work for both.

## Run the Gradio App
We also provide a Gradio web app which can be used to interactively experiment
with PIPS from the browser. To run the app, run the following:
```bash
python src/pips/gradio_app.py
```

The web app provides an interface for entering API keys through the browser, so
they do not need to be configured beforehand.

## Supported providers
PIPS supports any OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google model through their API
endpoints. Models hosted with VLLM are also supported.

## Sessions and exports
Per-Instance Program Synthesis stores runs in browser local storage, shipping
with curated examples on first launch. You can export or import sessions as
JSON filesâ€”handy for sharing baselines or reproducing papers.
